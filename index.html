         <article>
            <p>My very first car, at the age of 17. Was a 2004 Buick Regal LS.</p>
            <p>This vehicle came with the 3.8L V6 motore paired with a 4 speed automatic transmission.</p>
            <p>I bought it with about 107k miles on the dash  for only $3000.</p>
            <p>Although, it had a good about of mileage on the dash. This car never gave me any issues and drove great!</p>
            <p>I had this vehicle, up to about 111k miles, before trading it in for my next vehicle.</p>
